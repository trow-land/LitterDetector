# LitterDetector
This project started me on my machine learning and computer vision journey. It was a touch introduction and highlighted both the strengths and weaknesses of using computer vision for a system as varied as this. 

## Images
Inference examples can be found in the [images](https://github.com/trow-land/LitterDetector/tree/main/images) folder. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for both implementations was the Trash Annotated in Context dataset [website](http://tacodataset.org/), [github](https://github.com/pedropro/TACO), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06975). 

The dataset used for the university piece was eventually changed significantly, augmented with extra images from the _unofficial_ set of images and reduced down to focus on few key litter classes.
