# LitterDetector
This project started me on my machine learning and computer vision journey. It was a touch introduction and highlighted both the strengths and weaknesses of using computer vision for a system as varied as this. 

This repository contains my work on leveraging machine learning models for detecting litter in a variety of contexts.

## Inference Examples
For a sneak peek into our project's results, please refer to the [images](https://github.com/trow-land/LitterDetector/tree/main/images) folder where you'll find examples of our models' inference outputs.

## Dataset
For the purpose of this project, we utilised the Trash Annotated in Context (TACO) dataset. You can learn more about it on its [official website](http://tacodataset.org/), [Github repository](https://github.com/pedropro/TACO), or read about it in this [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06975). 

We eventually made substantial modifications to the dataset used for the university part of this project. It was augmented with additional images from the unofficial set, my own images and narrowed down to concentrate on a few key classes of litter.

## Repository Contents

### Litter Detection with YOLOv5
We explore the use of the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm for real-time object detection. This section includes the implementation details and results.

### Litter Detection and Instance Segmentation with Detectron2 Mask R-CNN
Here we dive into a more advanced approach to litter detection by implementing the Mask R-CNN model through the Detectron2 library. This model not only detects the litter but also performs instance segmentation to precisely locate each item within the image.

### Litter Detection with Computer Vision (Undergraduate Dissertation Thesis)
This section contains my undergraduate dissertation on litter detection using traditional computer vision techniques. It offers a deep dive into the foundations of computer vision applied to a real-world problem.

## Get in Touch

I am currently seeking opportunities as a Computer Vision Engineer within the UK. I hope the projects shared in this repository clearly demonstrate my dedication and enthusiasm for Computer Vision, particularly in the context of Agri-Tech and environmental sustainability. I am excited to put this enthusiasm to use in a role where I can make a positive impact on agriculture, environment, and beyond.

Apart from professional opportunities, I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussions in the field of Computer Vision. If you'd like to connect, offer advice on improving my projects, or discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out.
